//   Any pattern that vanishes, but only after a long time.  The
   following example vanishes in 130 generations, which is probably the
   limit for patterns of 7 or fewer cells.  Note that there is no limit
   for higher numbers of cells.  E.g., for 8 cells we could have a
   glider heading towards an arbitrarily distant blinker.

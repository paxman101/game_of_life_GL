//  (31c/240 orthogonally, p240)  The smallest known {31c/240}
   spaceship, constructed by Chris Cain in September 2014 as a
   refinement of the {shield bug}.

:century: (stabilizes at time 103)  This is a common pattern which
   evolves into three {block}s and a {blinker}.  In June 1996 Dave
   Buckingham built a neat {p246 gun} using a century as the engine.
   See also {bookend} and {diuresis}.

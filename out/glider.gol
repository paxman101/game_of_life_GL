//  (c/4 diagonally, p4)  The smallest, most common and first
   discovered {spaceship}.  This was found by Richard Guy in 1970 while
   Conway's group was attempting to track the {evolution} of the
   {R-pentomino}.  The name is due in part to the fact that it is
   {glide symmetric}.  (It is often stated that Conway discovered the
   glider, but he himself has said it was Guy.  See also the cryptic
   reference ("some guy") in {Winning Ways}.)

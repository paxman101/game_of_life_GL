//   = {tagalong}

:tumbler: (p14)  The smallest known p14 {oscillator}.  Found by George
   Collins in 1970.  The oscillator generates {domino} {spark}s, but
   they are fragile and no use has been found for them to date.  In each
   domino, one cell is "held" (remains alive) for two generations, the
   other for three.  By contrast, useful domino sparks are usually alive
   for only one tick per oscillator {period}.

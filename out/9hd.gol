//   Separated by 9 {half diagonal}s.  Specifically used to describe
   the distance between the two {construction lane}s in the
   {linear propagator}.

:Achim's p144: (p144)  This was found (minus the blocks shown below) on
   a cylinder of width 22 by Achim Flammenkamp in July 1994.  Dean
   Hickerson reduced it to a finite form using {figure-8}s the same day.
   The neater finite form shown here, replacing the figure-8s with
   blocks, was found by David Bell in August 1994.  See {factory} for a
   use of this oscillator.

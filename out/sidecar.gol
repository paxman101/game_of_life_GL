//   A small {tagalong} for an {HWSS} that was found by Hartmut
   Holzwart in 1992.  The resulting {spaceship} (shown below) has a
   {phase} with only 24 cells, making it in this respect the smallest
   known spaceship other than the {standard spaceship}s and some trivial
   two-spaceship {flotilla}s derived from them.  Note also that an HWSS
   can support two sidecars at once.

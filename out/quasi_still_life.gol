//   A {stable} {constellation} where the individual
   {still life}s share dead cells, so the neighborhoods of those dead
   cells are changed, but all cells that used to remain dead from
   under-population still do so.  Under Life rules, this occurs when
   objects are diagonally adjacent (e.g., two {block}s sharing a single
   diagonal neighbor) or when single protruding cells in two objects
   such as {tub}s share multiple neighbors.  The term is due to Mark
   Niemiec.

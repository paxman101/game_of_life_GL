//  (stabilizes at time 148)  This is a very common
   {methuselah} that evolves into three {block}s, two {glider}s and a
   {ship} after 148 generations. Compare with {Herschel}, which appears
   at generation 20 of the B-heptomino's evolution. B-heptominoes
   acquired particular importance in 1996 due to Dave Buckingham's work
   on {B track}s.  See in particular
   {My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators}.

//   The cells of an {oscillator} that change state.  Compare
   {stator}.  It is easy to see that any rotor cell must be adjacent to
   another rotor cell.

:R-pentomino:  This is by far the most active {polyomino} with less than
   six cells: all the others stabilize in at most 10 generations, but
   the R-pentomino does not do so until generation 1103, by which time
   it has a {population} of 116, including six {glider}s.

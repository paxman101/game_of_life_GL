//  ((5120,1024)c/33699586 obliquely, p33699586)  The first
   {self-constructing} spaceship, and also the first {oblique}
   spaceship.  It was made public by Andrew Wade on 18 May 2010.  It was
   the thirteenth explicitly constructed spaceship velocity in Life, and
   made possible an infinite family of related velocities.  The Gemini
   spaceship derives its name from the Latin "gemini", meaning twins,
   describing its two identical halves, each of which contains three
   Chapman-Greene {construction arm}s. A tape of gliders continually
   relays between the two halves, instructing each to delete its parent
   and construct a daughter configuration.

:Gemini puffer:  See {Pianola breeder}.

:Geminoid:  A type of self-constructing circuitry that borrows key ideas
   from Andrew Wade's {Gemini} spaceship, but with several
   simplifications.  The main feature common to the Gemini spaceship is
   the construction recipe encoding method.  Information is stored
   directly, and much more efficiently, in the timings of moving
   gliders, rather than in a static tape with 1s and 0s encoded by the
   presence of small stationary objects.
     Unlike the original Gemini, Geminoids have {ambidextrous}
   construction arms, initially using glider pairs on two lanes
   separated by 9{hd}, 10hd, or 0hd. The design was the basis for the
   {linear propagator} and the {Demonoid}s.  A more recent development
   is a Geminoid toolkit using a {single-channel} construction arm,
   which allows for the possibility of multiple elbows with no loss of
   efficiency, or the construction of temporary lossless elbows.
   Compare {slow elbow}.
     Other new developments that could be considered part of the
   extended "Geminoid" toolkit include {freeze-dried} construction
   salvos and seeds, used when objects must be built within a short time
   window, and self-destruct circuits, which are used as an alternative
   to a {destructor arm} to clean up temporary objects in a similarly
   short window.

:generation:  The fundamental unit of time.  The starting pattern is
   generation 0.

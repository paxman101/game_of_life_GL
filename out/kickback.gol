//   = {kickback reaction} or {180-degree kickback}.

:kickback reaction:  The following collision of two {glider}s whose
   product is a single glider travelling in the opposite direction to
   one of the original gliders.  This is important in the proof of the
   existence of a {universal constructor}, and in Bill Gosper's
   {total aperiodic}, as well as a number of other constructions.

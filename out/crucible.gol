//   = {cauldron}

:crystal:  A regular growth that is sometimes formed when a stream of
   {glider}s, or other {spaceship}s, is fired into some junk.
     The most common example is initiated by the following collision of
   a glider with a {block}.  With a glider stream of even {period} at
   least 82, this gives a crystal which forms a pair of {beehive}s for
   every 11 gliders which hit it.
